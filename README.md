# Beware Space
A game made with Lua and the LÃ–VE 2D game engine!

A little background: the project began in Oct 28, 2013
as 2 day game jam Bacon Game Jam #6 or BGJ06.
5 years later I decided it's worth trying to create an actual game
out of this prototype.

I will try adding more game play mechanics, graphical assets
and story in the coming future, see where this goes.

Anyone who wanna help in artistic way or by contributing code
 is welcomed to do so. The only two restriction are:
  
1. the game should be hardcore arcade, local score board, maybe online in future.
2. the game is about shooting shit and seeing nice explosions,
 in a space themed environment!
